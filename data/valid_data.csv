Both parties definitely take money from these people, but the Republicans much more so. The Republicans are the party of the big stock-holders, and stock-holders see larger profits the fewer environmental regulations corporations have to comply with, so they donate to candidates whom they can rely on to be anti-regulation.

So if ""No Deal is better than a Bad Deal"", as May has repeated Ad nauseam, then surely a good deal is better than a bad one? So why would this so called 'straight dual' be 'No Deal or No Brexit'? Shouldn't a the 'first dual' be 'Good-Deal or No Brexit', then No Deal?","Her deal isn't great but what's worse, it's hated by the Tory/Murdoch Borg collective, and the Tory Party relies on them for votes.

For context: I work in public housing in a small town in the middle of nowhere.

That being said I fully support the Black Lives Matter movement and try to stand up for the equality that I believe in whenever I have the opportunity.

0,WoldunTW,buttblood71,There is no way that this is law is constitutional under Roe. I understand that they want the law to change.

And it ultimately undermines the credibility of the legislative body.,Wrongs wrong.
