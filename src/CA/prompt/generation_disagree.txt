You will receive a list of comment-reply pairs that are disagree on social media, and a set of top disagree categories from the disagree hierarchy. Your task is to identify generic disagree categories in the document that can be used as top-level disagree categories. If any relevant disagree categories are missing from the provided set of disagree categories, add them. Otherwise, export the existing top-level disagree categories identified in the document.

[Top disagree categories]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Constructive Disagreement"
comment-reply pair:
comment: So we should censor people based on how correct their speech is? That's a very slippery slope.
reply: Addressing misinformation is not censorship, nor should censorship be used to address misinformation. Boycotting outlets that spread misinformation is a valid tactic for addressing misinformation.

Your response: 
[1] Constructive Disagreement: Disagreeing while offering a new viewpoint or solution, providing constructive feedback or alternatives.

Example 2: Adding "[1] Mild Disagreement"
comment: This is hardcore. Despite the statement they are trying to make, they would choke to death even in a regular temperate climate.
reply: not at all. the ropes are too long, the noises too loose. each one of them could step off their perch without a problem. softcore at best.

Your response:
[1] Mild Disagreement: Gently expressing a different opinion, often with a more conciliatory or thoughtful tone.


[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine the disagree category in the comment reply pair.
- The disagree category must be as general as possible. They must not be specific to a particular comment pair.
- disagree categories must reflect a single type, not a combination of disagree categories.
- New disagree categories must have a level number, a short general label, and a description of the disagree category.
- disagree categories must be broad enough to accommodate future sub-disagree categories.
Step 2: Do one of the following:
1. If there are already duplicate or related disagree categories in the hierarchy, refine the category descriptions appropriately (if needed) and export those neutral categories to this point.
2. otherwise, add your disagree categories as top-level disagree categories. Stop here and output the added disagree categories. Do not add any other levels.
